    <h2>What is KS Photography?</h2>

    <div>
        <h3><u>General</u></h3>
        <p>KS Photography is a dual-purpose web application designed to demonstrate my abilities as a software engineer while showcasing my own photography.</p>

        <h3><u>Limited Functionality</u></h3>
        <p>As a portfolio example, I believe it is important to present a fully functional application. However, I feel it necessary to employ certain restrictions in order to avoid possible misrepresentation of myself. Therefore, all user-initiated additions, edits and updates have been purposely limited and use front-end storage only. This means that no user changes will permanently impact the content of the application.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3><u>Construction</u></h3>
        <p>
            This application utilizes the MEAN stack of web development. It is written in JavaScript using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, employs a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> database, and is stylized with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">UI Bootstrap</a>, and <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a>. All photos are original images taken by and/or owned by Kyle Seem.
        </p>
        <p>You can review the code for this application in my <a href="https://github.com/KyleSeem/portfolio_site_content/tree/master/photo_gallery">GitHub repository</a>. Thank you for visiting!</p>
